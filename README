jpad stands for Java Production Auditing Driver

It is a very small lightweight proxy JDBC driver
that sits between your application and the real JDBC driver.

It intercepts method calls for certain key classes
and asynchronously passes each method call and its arguments
to another event handling layer that can interpret, analyze, store, log, etc.
interesting things about how your application is accessing the database.
